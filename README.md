Keep your device updated: Regularly install updates to ensure your device has the latest security patches.
Use antivirus software: Employ reliable antivirus solutions to detect and remove malware.
5. The Broader Implications of Android RAT Malware
The rise of Android RATs, including CraxsRAT, underscores the growing threat posed by mobile malware.
